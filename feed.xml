            <description>i called them after class earlier today, told them about the payment not going through, and it's _supposedly_ on their side and 
not my uni's.

the operator was chill about it, made a ticket right after the call, with details and shit that i'm supposed to do.

please work.

stupid fucking uni not accepting my payment, said i _didn't_ paid the tuition fees, now
every fucking thing about the uni doesn't work for me because i _did't_ pay the shit. so fucking stressed out about it.
contacted my PA about it, told me to wait for the student department response. fuck this shit man.

            <description>for the past 2 days, i've been playing terraria on and off. i have zero fucking clue on how to do anything in this game

so most of the time i was just reading the wiki trying to figure shit out. 

i had the game for YEARS and i never took the time to actually play it. 

hours down the line later i can say that the game is actually kinda fun, albeit very grindy, 
but that's part of the fun now i have a super-fucking-fast pickaxe compared to what i had a day ago, its nice seeing the progression. 

>attached picture is me accidentaly summoning the fucker during mining, i died instantly.

>broke as fuck
>steam summer sale 2024
>only had 2 dollars to spend
>found this silly little game called <a style="color: var(--red-text);text-decoration: underline;" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/70400/Recettear_An_Item_Shops_Tale/"> [Recettear] </a>
<<it's exactly 2 dollar
best to say, it was a good idea to buy it because HOLY FUCK this game is FUN.

TLDR; the lore of the game is that your father has a debt and you (a kid in this game) gotta pay it yourself, so you set up a shop to pay the debt
every week. 

the fun part is selling the item and haggling over it, you can literally rip off people for like a lot of money, shit is like shekels simulator but place, japan.

sometimes there will be people coming to SELL you stuff, you can also haggle this, usually you can get it for like 40-50% of the price and then sell it later on at 130% markup, shit is crazy man.

>10/10 good game, you should try it.

            <description>so, it turns out, i somehow lost access to my registrar account.


<<i didn't have it registered in my 2fa app
<<i also somehow lost the backup codes
>can't renew the domain


the ship sank, it is what is is. i will now be using [kafu.ovh](https://kafu.ovh) instead!


i saved the dumbass backup code to my every cloud account i had. hopefully no more 2fa fuck ups!!!

i've been looking at my local train's map recently... 

kinda cool how i can just take one and just end up at the other side of the country...

maybe i should do that, who knows, it might fix whatever the fuck is wrong with me. just going balls out
to fucking nowhere by myself, alone, experiencing the world.

honestly, i have all these knowledge but i never make people pay for it.

it feels really weird to charge people for something as simple as formatting windows and installing the usual office programs (around 20$).

do i just know too much (or too little, rather) or 

is this just how the real world works like, you get pay for what you know (and exploit those who dont),

is my view on this is dark or what, i dont get it. maybe im just so accustomed to not receiving any kind of thanks or anything in return for helping people, who knows...

my boss been telling me that i need to charge people for everything i do, dont be nice to them, you get what you pay for kinda deal... alright  ┐(´ー｀)┌

been thinking about my course recently, i feel like i just made a major mistake.
maybe taking electronic engineering wasnt a great idea after all. don't get me wrong, i like it, it's just that... stuff happened and people did me dirty and that really killed my passion for this field, i'm thinking of changing my course to software engineering and do it the easy way since that's what i'm most familiar with.... 

<br>

and, i'm not joking when i said people did me dirty, they really did, to the point where i had a emotional breakdown.
which, says a lot cuz _i'm a tough guy_, edgylord-tier kinda, no emotion basically, so that's saying a lot.

<hr>

for now, i just don't want to think about it....

            <description>looking at V discord channel, seems like theres some kind of drama going on there. <br/>
kinda sad that 2 of the big guys left. almost feels like the language itself is about to die, i hope not. <br/>
the language is genuinely cool. while they overpromised lots of stuff, the language itself does work as a programming language and thats good enough for me. <br/>
seems like its not for other people, oh well.  <br/>
praying for my man l-m over there at [me.l-m.dev][l-m], he did a lot of work on the language's web assembly stuff recently :<<

            <description>>Figured out how to exploit my uni's wifi for free.
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Kill wlan0 for abit.
sudo networkctl down wlan0

# Change mac address (temporarily)
sudo macchanger -r wlan0

# Revive the shit.
sudo networkctl up wlan0

# Get the new macaddr value
new_mac=$(ifconfig wlan0 | grep --color=never  -oE '([[:xdigit:]]{1,2}:){5}[[:xdigit:]]{1,2}')  

# Activate the shit the shit.
echo "Opening trial activator thingamajig."
xdg-open "https://wifi.aeronet.com.my/login?username=T-${new_mac^^}"
```
Turns out, my uni's *PAID* wifi trial didn't really check for mac addresses properly, 
so I can do goofy shit like this and get free wifi without paying. very cool.
